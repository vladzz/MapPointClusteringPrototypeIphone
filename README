Map Clustering Prototype
------------------------
This Project will demonstrate the ability to cluster annotation pins on a Mapkit map view.
The prototype currently uses a database containing POI data. There is around 2500 POI in the
database.

The current clustering is based on pixels on the screen and the distance between them. This is effective.
The current demo will cluster all annotations on the current map region. So when the map
region moves all annotations are removed and re-clustered. This does work but I rekon doesn't
look that seemless to the user.

Mainly cluster classes
----------------------
AssetClusterAnnotation - Represents a visual annotation on the map that can be made up of 1 or more annotations
AnnotationClusterer - Does the hard work of getting a annotation and putting it into the correct cluster annotation.


TO-DO List
----------
- Only re-cluster when the map zoom changes
- Only re-cluster new points as they are added.
